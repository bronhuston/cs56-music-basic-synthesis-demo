# Example run
	java -cp build  edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.music.basic_synthesis_demo.Melody 0.1 0.2 0.6 1.0 0.2

The parameters are: attack, decay, sustain amplitude, sustain time, release.

attack: The number of seconds to attack for. (0 - 1.0)

decay: The amount of time to decay/sustain. (0 - 1.0)

sustain amplitude: The sustained volume. (0 - 1.0)

sustain time: The time to sustain for. (0 - 1.0)

release: The amount of time to release over. (0 - 1.0)

# Gui Example run
	ant basicGUI
		
GUI is simply a skeleton, and is not functional

# Melody Example run
	java -cp build edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.music.basic_synthesis_demo.Melody_Code.Melody 0.1 0.2 0.6 1.0 0.2
	-OR-
	ant melody

This will play the Melody contained in the file Default.txt (found in the resources folder)

To play more than one melody in a row, use 

	java -cp build edu.ucsb.cs56.projects.music.basic_synthesis_demo.Melody_Code.Melody 0.1 0.2 0.6 1.0 0.1 3 YellowSub.txt MaryHadALittleLamb.txt Default.txt 

This will play the Melodies contained in the files YellowSub.txt, MaryHadALittleLamb.txt, and Default.txt one after another. 
The Melodies in the files will be played in the order that they are entered. All of the text files to be played must be in the resource folder.

the parameters are: attack, decay, sustain amp, sustain time, release, the number of files to play, and the names of the files containing the melodies

# Melody GUI Example
	ant melodyGUI

Currently throws errors when play is attempted
